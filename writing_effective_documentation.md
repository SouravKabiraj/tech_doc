# Writing Effective Documentation by Beth Aitman
## Start with What the Reader Needs
Documentation serves the purpose of guiding readers toward achieving a specific goal.

## Write Less
Avoid excessive verbosity in your documentation, as documents overloaded with text become challenging to update.

## Write the Outline First
Begin by posing critical questions and use them as the basis for your document's headings. Once you have answers and notes, structure your document accordingly.

<ul>
<li>Who is the intended audience?</li>        
<li>What is the reader trying to accomplish?</li>
<li>How can the reader achieve their goal?</li>
</ul>

## Rubber Ducking
When faced with difficulties in articulating information, consider the "rubber ducking" method: verbally explain the content, record it, and then transcribe it into written form.

## Write Readably
Develop well-organized documentation with concise sentences. Eliminate unnecessary phrases like "there are/is."

## It's Not Just About Documentation
Instead of solely documenting a problem, explore the possibility of fixing it when feasible.
